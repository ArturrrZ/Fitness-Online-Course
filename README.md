Capstone Project CS50W

I've created an online educational platform.
The main idea of web application is to connect creators and students all over the world in essential topics such as fitness, nutriotion and proffessional sports.
There is a free content to help creators to get attention from students. Also you can find there paid courses with verified certificate after the completion.

Student are able to leave a comment for the free content, rate the course. So it will help themselves to filter and define the best option. 
Moreover, there is a possibily to search a course by name, filter by rating,language,price and also sort by date,alphabet,price.  


CODE OVERVIEW.

The application is developed using Django, with SQLite as the database for efficient data management and storage. The frontend is styled with CSS and enhanced with Bootstrap for responsive design elements, such as the navigation bar. For dynamic interactivity, the platform employs JavaScript, with a significant emphasis on React (sourced through CDN), to enrich the user experience with features like live search results, comments, ratings, and bookmarking.

Additionally, the search functionality is augmented by JavaScript and React to include filters for courses based on price, rating, and language. This allows users to tailor their search results to meet specific preferences, making it easier to find courses that match their needs and interests.
